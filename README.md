Currently working on the development of a real-time driver fatigue detection system powered by large language models (LLMs) and multimodal sensor fusion. The system aims to improve road safety by monitoring drivers' behavioral cues and driving patterns and proactively detecting signs of drowsiness or inattention.

Current Focus: Data Capture Module

- Developing the core module for real-time data acquisition from CARLA and an IR camera.
- Ensuring multimodal compatibility, signal accuracy, and synchronized data pipelines for robust analysis.
- Closely collaborating with signal processing and feature extraction teams to align input data for fatigue detection.
